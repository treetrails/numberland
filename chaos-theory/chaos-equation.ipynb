    "\n",
    "A study of iterations with another quadratic equation `f(x) = kx(1-x)` was a cornerstone in a related development of the science of chaos. This is a well known __logisitic equation__. The process __x<sub>n+1</sub> = kx<sub>n</sub>(1 - x<sub>n</sub>)__ often closely describes a population change from year `n` to the next year `n+1`. The first term `kx` reflects the reproduction tendency which is proportional to the present population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The need to coexist and share resources is presented by the inhibiting term `(1-x)`. Robert May, an Australian mathematician engrossed in Biology, studied the global behavior of the process in its dependency on the selection of the coefficient `k`."
